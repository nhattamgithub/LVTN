            THE SUSTAINATIONS D.A.O PLEDGE

          <Typography className="mt-32 justify-center">
            A deep love of the environment and a recognition of the need to take strong, immediate action to protect is at the heart of everything we do. By joining our D.A.O, you're joining us in our mission to meaningful solutions to the growing ecological crisis. It means a lot to us, so we're offering all who sign the Sustainations Pledge a humble amount of token. You're already doing a lot by visiting our D.A.O, so please accept this gift as our show of thanks.
          </Typography>
          <Typography className="mt-32 justify-center">
            On top of that, we invite you to grow a Sustainable Fund that we're using to advance a series of sustainability projects, including a plastic waste reduction program via Sustainations Refill Stations, tree and coral planting via Sustainations Metaverse... We're a blockchain D.A.O, but we're also much more than that. Similarly, you're more than just a member and a consumer. You're an important part of the change we all need to make together to chart a different course for the Earth and all those who share our home.
